/** Determines whether to receive raw audio data from multiple channels.

 @since v3.5.0

 After you register the audio frame observer, the SDK triggers this callback
 every time it captures an audio frame.

 In a multi-channel scenario, if you want to get audio data from multiple
 channels, set the return value of this callback as `YES`, and set the return
 value of [getObservedAudioFramePosition]([AgoraAudioDataFrameProtocol getObservedAudioFramePosition]) as
 `AgoraAudioFramePositionBeforeMixing (1 << 3)`. After that, the SDK triggers
 the [onPlaybackAudioFrameBeforeMixingEx]([AgoraAudioDataFrameProtocol onPlaybackAudioFrameBeforeMixingEx:channelId:uid:])
 callback to send you the before-mixing audio data from various channels. You
 can also get the channel ID of each audio frame.

 **Note**

 - Once you set the return value of this callback as `YES`, the SDK triggers
 only the `onPlaybackAudioFrameBeforeMixingEx` callback to send the
 before-mixing audio frame.
 [onPlaybackAudioFrameBeforeMixing]([AgoraAudioDataFrameProtocol onPlaybackAudioFrameBeforeMixing:uid:])
 is not triggered. In a multi-channel scenario, Agora recommends setting the
 return value as `YES`.
 - If you set the return value of this callback as `NO`, the SDK triggers only
 the `onPlaybackAudioFrameBeforeMixing` callback to send the audio data.

 @return - `YES`: Receive audio data from multiple channels.
 - `NO`: Do not receive audio data from multiple channels.

 To trigger this callback, you need to register the following callbacks and

 - [getObservedAudioFramePosition]([AgoraAudioDataFrameProtocol getObservedAudioFramePosition]):
 Set its return value as `AgoraAudioFramePositionBeforeMixing (1 << 3)`.
 - [isMultipleChannelFrameWanted]([AgoraAudioDataFrameProtocol isMultipleChannelFrameWanted]):

/** Sets the audio observation positions.

 @since v3.4.5

 After you successfully register the audio delegate, the SDK uses the
 [getObservedAudioFramePosition]([AgoraAudioDataFrameProtocol getObservedAudioFramePosition])
 callback to determine at each specific audio-frame processing node whether to
 trigger the following callbacks:

 - [onRecordAudioFrame]([AgoraAudioDataFrameProtocol onRecordAudioFrame:])
 - [onPlaybackAudioFrame]([AgoraAudioDataFrameProtocol onPlaybackAudioFrame:])
 - [onMixedAudioFrame]([AgoraAudioDataFrameProtocol onMixedAudioFrame:])
 - [onPlaybackAudioFrameBeforeMixing]([AgoraAudioDataFrameProtocol onPlaybackAudioFrameBeforeMixing:uid:])
 or [onPlaybackAudioFrameBeforeMixingEx]([AgoraAudioDataFrameProtocol onPlaybackAudioFrameBeforeMixingEx:channelId:uid:])

 You can set the positions that you want to observe by modifying the return
 value of `getObservedAudioFramePosition` according to your scenario.

 **Note**:

 - To observe multiple positions, use `|` (the OR operator).
 - The default return value of `getObservedAudioFramePosition` is
 `AgoraAudioFramePositionPlayback (1 << 0)` and
 `AgoraAudioFramePositionRecord (1 << 1)`.
 - To conserve system resources, you can reduce the number of frame positions
 that you want to observe.

 @return The bit mask that controls the audio observation positions.
