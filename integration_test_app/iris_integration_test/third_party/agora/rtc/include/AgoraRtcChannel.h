After joining multiple channels, you can simultaneously subscribe to streams of all the channels, but publish a stream in only one channel at one time.

/** Joins the channel with a user ID.

 Compared with the
 [joinChannelByToken]([AgoraRtcEngineKit joinChannelByToken:channelId:info:uid:options:])
 method in the `AgoraRtcEngineKit` class, this method supports joining multiple
 channels at a time by creating multiple `AgoraRtcChannel`objects and then
 calling `joinChannelByToken` in each `AgoraRtcChannel` object.

 Once the user joins the channel, the user publishes the local audio and video
 streams and automatically subscribes to the audio and video streams of all the
 other users in the channel by default. Subscribing incurs all associated usage
 costs. To unsubscribe, set the `options` parameter or call the `mute`
 methods accordingly.

 **Note**

 - If you are already in a channel, you cannot rejoin it with the same `uid`.
 - If you want to join the same channel from different devices, ensure that the `uid` in all devices are different.
 - Ensure that the app ID you use to generate the token is the same with the app ID used when creating the AgoraRtcEngineKit instance.

 @param token The token generated at your server. See [Authenticate Your Users with Tokens](https://docs.agora.io/en/Interactive%20Broadcast/token_server?platform=All%20Platforms).
 @param info (Optional) Additional information about the channel. This parameter can be set as `nil`. Other users in the channel do not receive this information.
 @param uid The user ID. A 32-bit unsigned integer with a value ranging from 1 to (2<sup>32</sup>-1). This parameter must be unique. If `uid` is not assigned (or set as 0), the SDK assigns a `uid` and reports it in the [rtcChannelDidJoinChannel]([AgoraRtcChannelDelegate rtcChannelDidJoinChannel:withUid:elapsed:]) callback. The app must maintain this user ID.
 @param options The channel media options: AgoraRtcChannelMediaOptions

  - `-3`(`AgoraErrorCodeNotReady`): The SDK fails to be initialized. You can try re-initializing the SDK.

 This feature effectively boosts the resolution of a remote user's video seen
 by the local user. If the original resolution of a remote user's video is a × b,
 the local user's device can render the remote video at a resolution of 2a × 2b
 after you enable this feature.

 After calling this method, the SDK triggers the
 [superResolutionEnabledOfUid]([AgoraRtcChannelDelegate rtcChannel:superResolutionEnabledOfUid:enabled:reason:])
 callback to report whether you have successfully enabled super resolution.

 **Warnings**

 The super resolution feature requires extra system resources. To balance the
 visual experience and system consumption, the SDK poses the following restrictions:

 - This feature can only be enabled for a single remote user.
 - The original resolution of the remote user's video cannot exceed 640 × 480 pixels.

 If you exceed these limitations, the SDK triggers the
 [didOccurWarning]([AgoraRtcChannelDelegate rtcChannel:didOccurWarning:])
 callback and returns the corresponding warning codes:

 - `AgoraWarningCodeSuperResolutionStreamOverLimitation(1610)`:
 The original resolution of the remote user's video is beyond the range where
 super resolution can be applied.
 - `AgoraWarningCodeSuperResolutionUserCountOverLimitation(1611)`: Super
 resolution is already being used to boost another remote user's video.
 - `AgoraWarningCodeSuperResolutionDeviceNotSupported(1612)`: The device does
 not support using super resolution.

 **Notes**

 - This method is for iOS only.
 - Before calling this method, ensure that you have integrated the
 `AgoraSuperResolutionExtension.xcframework` dynamic library into your project.
 - Because this method has certain system performance requirements, Agora
 recommends that you use the following iOS devices (iOS 12.0 or later) or better:

   - iPhone XR
   - iPhone XS
   - iPhone XS Max
   - iPhone 11
   - iPhone 11 Pro
   - iPhone 11 Pro Max
   - iPhone 12
   - iPhone 12 mini
   - iPhone 12 Pro
   - iPhone 12 Pro Max
