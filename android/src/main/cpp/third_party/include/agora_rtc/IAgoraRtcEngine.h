   This method works for all remote users that join or will join a channel

   equivalent to the `autoSubscribeVideo` member in the ChannelMediaOptions
   class.
   - Ensure that you call this method after joining a channel.
   - If you call muteAllRemoteVideoStreams(true) after joining a channel, the
   local use stops receiving any video stream from any user in the channel,
   including any user who joins the channel after you call this method.
   - If you call muteAllRemoteVideoStreams(true) after leaving a channel,
   the local user does not receive any video stream the next time the user
   joins a channel.

   After you successfully call muteAllRemoteVideoStreams(true), you can take
   the following actions:
   - To resume receiving all remote video streams, call
   muteAllRemoteVideoStreams(false).
   - To resume receiving the video stream of a specified user, call
   muteRemoteVideoStream(uid, false), where uid is the ID of the user whose
