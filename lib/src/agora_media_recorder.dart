The SDK can generate a recording file only when it detects audio and video streams; when there are no audio and video streams to be recorded or the audio and video streams are interrupted for more than five seconds, the SDK stops the recording and triggers the onRecorderStateChanged(recorderStateError, recorderErrorNoStream) callback.Once the recording is started, if the video resolution is changed, the SDK stops the recording; if the sampling rate and audio channel changes, the SDK continues recording and generates audio files respectively.Call this method after joining a channel.
