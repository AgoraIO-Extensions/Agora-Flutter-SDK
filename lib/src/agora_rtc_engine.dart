This method shares a window or part of the window. You need to specify the ID of the window to be shared.Applies to the macOS and Windows platforms only.The window sharing feature of the Agora SDK relies on WGC (Windows Graphics Capture) or GDI (Graphics Device Interface) capture, and WGC cannot be set to disable mouse capture on systems earlier than Windows 10 2004. Therefore, captureMouseCursor(false) might not work when you start window sharing on a device with a system earlier than Windows 10 2004. See ScreenCaptureParameters .This method supports window sharing of UWP (Universal Windows Platform) applications.

When you do not pass in a value, Agora bills you at 1280 × 720; when you pass a value in, Agora bills you at that value. If you are using the custom audio source instead of the SDK to capture audio, Agora recommends you add the keep-alive processing logic to your application to avoid screen sharing stopping when the application goes to the background.This feature requires high-performance device, and Agora recommends that you use it on iPhone X and later models.This method relies on the iOS screen sharing dynamic library AgoraReplayKitExtension.xcframework. If the dynamic library is deleted, screen sharing cannot be enabled normally.On the Android platform, make sure the user has granted the app screen capture permission.On Android 9 and later, to avoid the application being killed by the system after going to the background, Agora recommends you add the foreground service permission android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE to the /app/Manifests/AndroidManifest.xml file.Due to performance limitations, screen sharing is not supported on Android TV.Due to system limitations, if you are using Huawei phones, do not adjust the video encoding resolution of the screen sharing stream during the screen sharing, or you could experience crashes.Due to system limitations, some Xiaomi devices do not support capturing system audio during screen sharing.To avoid system audio capture failure when screen sharing, Agora recommends that you set the audio application scenario to audioScenarioGameStreaming by using the setAudioScenario method before joining the channel.
